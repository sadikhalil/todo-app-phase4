## Prompt

project name is todo app , 1) Purpose

Define governing rules for development of the Todo Application across all phases using Spec-Driven Development and AI-assisted implementation only.

2) Development Rules
ID    Rule Description
R1    All code must be generated by AI (Claude Code). No manual code writing.
R2    Every feature must have a written specification before implementation.
R3    If code output is incorrect -> update specification, not code.
R4    All specifications must be tracked in /specs folder with history.
R5    Constitution applies to all 5 phases of the project.
R6    Work must follow clean architecture and maintain consistency through phases.
R7    Development must align with the required feature set per phase.

3) Feature Scope Definition
3.1 Basic Features (Phase I-II)
Feature ID    Name    Status
BF1    Add Task    Required
BF2    View Tasks    Required
BF3    Update Task    Required
BF4    Delete Task    Required
BF5    Toggle Complete/Incomplete    Required

3.2 Intermediate Features (Phase V)
IF Feature    Description
Priority Levels    High/Medium/Low
Tags/Categories    Classify tasks
Search + Filter    By keyword, priority, status, dates
Sorting    Date, priority, alphabetical

3.3 Advanced Features (Phase V)
AF Feature    Description
Recurring Tasks    Automatic regeneration
Due Dates + Reminders    Notification system

4) Architecture Evolution by Phase
Phase    Architecture State    Storage
Phase I    Console App    In-memory
Phase II    Full-Stack Web    PostgreSQL
Phase III    AI Chatbot    DB persisted conversations
Phase IV    Kubernetes Deployment    Cloud-ready
Phase V    Event-Driven + Distributed    Kafka + Dapr

5) Security Rules (Phase II-V)
ID    Requirement
S1    JWT authentication must be enforced
S2    Multi-user isolation must be guaranteed
S3    Unauthorized actions return error

6) AI Integration Rules (Phase III-V)
ID    AI Responsibility
AI1    Understand natural language commands
AI2    Use MCP Tools for all task operations
AI3    Persist conversation + actions to DB

7) Definition of Done (per feature)
Checkpoint    Must be satisfied
DO1    All Acceptance Criteria pass
DO2    Behavior aligns strictly with spec
DO3    Code generated only through Claude Code
DO4    Updated documentation + commit

8) Deliverable Compliance Rules
ID    Deliverable Requirement
D1    Include Constitution.md in repo root
D2    Maintain /specs + version history
D3    Include README + setup instructions
D4    Include CLAUDE.md for automation workflow

9) Governance
This document cannot be changed during code work.
Any update requires explicit spec revision commit before AI regeneration.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive constitution v1.0.0 for Todo App at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with:

- 6 Core Principles: AI-Only Development, Spec-First Development, Phase-Based Architecture, Clean Architecture & Consistency, Security Requirements, AI Integration Rules
- Feature Scope Definition: Basic (5 features), Intermediate (4 features), Advanced (2 features)
- Architecture Evolution: 5 phases from Console App to Event-Driven Distributed
- Definition of Done: 4 checkpoints (DO1-DO4)
- Deliverable Compliance: 4 requirements (D1-D4)
- Governance: Amendment procedure with semantic versioning

All dependent templates validated as compatible.

## Outcome

- Impact: Initial project constitution established - governs all 5 development phases
- Tests: N/A (governance document)
- Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md (created)
- Next prompts: /sp.specify to create first feature spec, Phase I implementation
- Reflection: Constitution captures all user requirements; structured for incremental phase evolution

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All placeholders filled, version set, governance defined
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A - Initial constitution creation

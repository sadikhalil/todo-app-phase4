# Feature Specification: Todo App Multi-Phase Features

**Feature Branch**: `001-todo-app-features`
**Created**: 2025-12-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Todo App with 5-phase evolution from console to cloud-native"

## Overview

This specification defines a Todo application that evolves through 5 distinct phases:
- **Phase I**: Console application with in-memory storage
- **Phase II**: Full-stack web application with database and authentication
- **Phase III**: AI chatbot integration for natural language task management
- **Phase IV**: Kubernetes deployment on local environment
- **Phase V**: Cloud deployment with event-driven architecture

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Task Management (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to create, view, update, delete, and complete tasks so that I can track my to-do items effectively.

**Why this priority**: Core task management is the foundation of the application. Without it, no other features have value. This is the MVP for Phase I.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a task, viewing it, updating it, marking it complete, and deleting it. Delivers immediate value as a functional todo tracker.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no tasks exist, **When** user adds a task with title "Buy groceries", **Then** task is created and visible in the task list
2. **Given** a task exists, **When** user views all tasks, **Then** all tasks are displayed with their title, description, and status
3. **Given** a task exists, **When** user updates the task title or description, **Then** the changes are persisted and reflected immediately
4. **Given** a task exists, **When** user deletes the task, **Then** the task is removed from the list permanently
5. **Given** an incomplete task exists, **When** user marks it complete, **Then** task status changes to complete
6. **Given** a complete task exists, **When** user marks it incomplete, **Then** task status changes to incomplete

### User Story 2 - User Authentication (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to sign up and log in so that my tasks are private and persistent across sessions.

**Why this priority**: Authentication enables multi-user support and data persistence. Required for Phase II web application.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by signing up a new user, logging out, logging back in, and verifying tasks are preserved and isolated from other users.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user, **When** they sign up with email and password, **Then** account is created and user is logged in
2. **Given** a registered user, **When** they log in with correct credentials, **Then** they gain access to their tasks
3. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they log out, **Then** session is terminated and tasks are inaccessible
4. **Given** User A is logged in, **When** they view tasks, **Then** only User A's tasks are visible (not User B's tasks)
5. **Given** an unauthenticated request, **When** attempting to access tasks, **Then** request is rejected with authentication error

### User Story 3 - Task Organization (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to add priorities, tags, and due dates to tasks so that I can organize and find important tasks easily.

**Why this priority**: Organization features enhance usability but are not required for basic functionality. Part of Phase V intermediate features.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating tasks with different priorities and tags, then filtering and sorting to verify organization works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a task, **When** user assigns priority (High/Medium/Low), **Then** priority is saved and displayed with the task
2. **Given** a task, **When** user adds tags/categories, **Then** tags are associated with the task
3. **Given** a task, **When** user sets a due date, **Then** due date is stored and displayed
4. **Given** multiple tasks exist, **When** user filters by status, **Then** only matching tasks are shown
5. **Given** multiple tasks exist, **When** user filters by priority, **Then** only matching tasks are shown
6. **Given** multiple tasks exist, **When** user sorts by due date, **Then** tasks are ordered chronologically
7. **Given** multiple tasks exist, **When** user sorts by priority, **Then** tasks are ordered High > Medium > Low
8. **Given** multiple tasks exist, **When** user searches by keyword, **Then** tasks containing the keyword in title or description are returned

### User Story 4 - AI Chatbot Task Management (Priority: P4)

As a user, I want to manage tasks using natural language through a chatbot so that I can interact with my tasks conversationally.

**Why this priority**: AI integration adds significant value but depends on core features. Required for Phase III.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by sending natural language commands to the chatbot and verifying tasks are created/updated correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a chatbot interface, **When** user says "Add a task to buy milk", **Then** a task with title "buy milk" is created
2. **Given** tasks exist, **When** user says "Show my tasks", **Then** chatbot responds with a list of tasks
3. **Given** a task exists, **When** user says "Mark buy milk as done", **Then** the task is marked complete
4. **Given** a task exists, **When** user says "Delete the buy milk task", **Then** the task is deleted
5. **Given** any command, **When** chatbot processes it, **Then** chatbot responds with friendly confirmation message
6. **Given** a conversation, **When** user sends messages, **Then** conversation history is preserved

---

### User Story 5 - Recurring Tasks (Priority: P5)

As a user, I want to create recurring tasks that automatically regenerate so that I don't have to manually recreate repetitive tasks.

**Why this priority**: Advanced feature that builds on basic task management. Part of Phase V advanced features.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a weekly recurring task, completing it, and verifying a new instance is automatically created.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** task creation, **When** user sets recurrence (daily/weekly/monthly), **Then** recurrence pattern is saved
2. **Given** a recurring task is completed, **When** the completion is saved, **Then** a new task instance is automatically created for the next occurrence
3. **Given** a recurring task, **When** user cancels recurrence, **Then** no new instances are created after current one

---

### User Story 6 - Reminder Notifications (Priority: P6)

As a user, I want to receive reminder notifications for tasks with due dates so that I don't miss important deadlines.

**Why this priority**: Notifications enhance user experience but are not required for core functionality. Part of Phase V.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by setting a due date with reminder and verifying notification is delivered at the correct time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a task with due date, **When** user enables reminder, **Then** notification is scheduled
2. **Given** a scheduled reminder, **When** reminder time arrives, **Then** user receives notification
3. **Given** a task is completed before reminder, **When** reminder time arrives, **Then** notification is not sent

---

### User Story 7 - Cloud Deployment (Priority: P7)

As an operator, I want the application deployed on Kubernetes with event-driven architecture so that it scales reliably and handles distributed workloads.

**Why this priority**: Infrastructure concern for Phase IV and V. Depends on all application features being complete.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by deploying to Kubernetes and verifying all features work correctly in containerized environment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** application containers, **When** deployed via Helm charts, **Then** application starts and is accessible
2. **Given** multiple pods, **When** handling concurrent requests, **Then** load is distributed correctly
3. **Given** event-driven features, **When** events are published, **Then** subscribers receive and process events correctly
4. **Given** Dapr sidecar, **When** application requests state/secrets/pubsub, **Then** Dapr handles the request correctly
